has been used to elaborate the data given by the API of Spotify. For the most
impartial sampling possible, all playlists of the profile of Spotify have been
taken, in addition, in order to be able to take a greater vast and varied quantity
of possible music tracks, this algorithm cares to extrapolate them directly from
the playlists that has been created and shared on the Spotify’s profile.
